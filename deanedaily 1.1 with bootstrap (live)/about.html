      <div id="paragraph-about"> <p>Although I created this website and all of it's contents, I want to start by saying that I am in no way advertising myself as a professional developer, designer, photographer or illustrator. Instead, I challenge you to think of this website as a way for me to showcase what I do know about these things.

When I reflect on my life, art shines as the unifying force. My parents enrolled me in art classes as a youngster and I have been hooked ever since. I developed an eye for detail that flourished when I experimented with different mediums in High School. Watercolour, pastels, acrylic paint, and charcoal became my tools for expression. My color blindness limited my ability to create realistic scenes. But through this shortcoming came a gift - a knack for contour drawing. Shortly after, the digital realm became an interest and I began working with vector software. I created contour art on my blog dailycontour.wordpress.com which I continued until I started at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Today, my interests lay at the confluence of design and content creation. I continue to draw and have also taken up photography. My story is still in the nacent stages and this fills me with curiosity since it is unclear as to where it could take me. I'm looking forward to what lies ahead and I hope you join me on this ride.</p></div>
